# Week_11
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to provide a website that will present UFO data in a visually appealing way. We took the UFO data and allowed for different filters to be applied to it alone or simultaneously. We used CSS to style our page to make it visually appealing.

## Results
Within the website you can filter by Date, City, State, Country, or Shape. For example if you wanted all UFO sightings from 1/1/2010 in San Diego you could search like the picture below.
![date_san_diego](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96025706/158104239-98a28d10-f87b-44fc-a951-566c667abd08.png)

or is you wanted all "light" shaped UFO's from California you could search like below.

## Summary
In conclusion one drawback of this approach is that only exactly matching the data fields will return results. To better accommodate all searching we would want to standardize all input to a lowercase format to match the data within the table. We would also need to format user input on dates.
